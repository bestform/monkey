Based on the book by [@thostenball](https://twitter.com/thorstenball) I started to write a lexer and parser for PHP (see [shmehashme](https://github.com/bestform/shmehashme))

This project here is based on the original book (http://interpreterbook.com) to help transfer the knowledge over
to the PHP project.
